## üß™ Project Overview

Accurate wound pH monitoring is critical for assessing healing progression and infection risk. This work embeds two core scientific equations into a machine learning framework:

- **Beer-Lambert Law**: models light absorbance as a function of dye concentration.
- **Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**: estimates pH based on red-blue intensity ratio, representing base-to-acid balance.

The resulting Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) provides more robust, interpretable, and physically consistent pH estimates than purely data-driven models.

## üöÄ How to Run the Notebooks

1. **Data Preprocessing** 
   - Run `Kalman.ipynb` to smooth sensor data (e.g., RGB values).
   - Save/export filtered data if used for training.

2. **Train Baseline Neural Network**
   - Open `NN.ipynb`
   - Train and evaluate a standard neural network model using extracted color features.

3. **Train Physics-Informed Neural Network**
   - Open `PINN.ipynb`
   - Train a PINN with custom loss functions based on:
     - Beer-Lambert law
     - Henderson-Hasselbalch equilibrium
